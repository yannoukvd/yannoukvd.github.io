					Here is an iOS 10 guide I’m currently working on. Part 1 - Lockscreen - is done, enjoy!
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>- Lockscreen - </b>
					<br>
					<br> <b>Rase to wake</b>
					<br>A problem in iOS 9 was the fact that you haven’t got any time to see your notifications on the Lock Screen when you pressed die Home Button because of the super fast Touch ID. In iOS 10, Apple fixed this issue with the “Raise to wake” function. If you want to see your Lock Screen, you just have to raise your device and it will wake up. The light and proximity sensors are also much smarter. For example if you tilt your device and look at it without touching the screen, the screen will stay on for a longer time than if you just tilt it up and put it back down immediately. The screen will also dim immediately when placing the device face down or in your pocket.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Press to unlock</b>
					<br> With iOS 10, Apple ditched the Slide to unlock function. Instead you have to press the Home Button to unlock it, which actually makes a lot more sense because it’s a lot easier and faster. If you use Touch ID, you probably stopped using that Slide to unlock function a while ago. On the other hand, if you don’t use Touch ID, by pressing the Home Button you wake up your device, and by pressing it a second time you can fill in your passcode (or directly unlock your device if you don’t have a password. I strongly advise you to use one though). In the overal it’s a lot faster to press a button than sliding your finger across the screen. The only disadvantage is, you have to get used to it because sliding from left to right on the screen will now bring you to your widgets, which brings me to the next feature.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Notifications</b>
					<br> On the Lock Screen you can see your incoming notifications. You can delete them by swiping on them to the left or go to the app by swiping on them to the right. On some of the notification you are able to 3D Touch on them to see extra functionalities like quick reply for Messages.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Widgets View &amp; Camera View</b>
					<br> Sliding to the right to the right on your Lock Screen will now bring you to the Widget View, were you can see all your widgets and were you can do a Spotlight search. Sliding to the left will bring you to the camera app were you can quickly take a picture or video.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Notification Center &amp; Control Center</b>
					<br> Sliding from the top of the Lock Screen will bring you to the Notification Center were you can see all your notifications. If you slide to the right from there, you will get to the widget view, that makes the widget view accessible from pretty much anywhere on the device. You can also do a Spotlight search in the Notification Center. Sliding from the bottom will bring you to the Control Center where you can toggle off and on some functions and were you can quickly access some small apps. If you slide to the left from there, you will get to the Now Playing View were you can control your music that is currently playing. Sliding another time to the left will bring you to the Home Kit View (if you have any Home Kit accessories) were you can control all your Home Kit compatible accessories.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Passcode</b>
					<br> There are 3 passcode options. The first one is a simple 4 digits passcode, the second one is a 6 digits passcode, and the third one is a combination of letters and eventually numbers. The longer the passcode, the more secure your iPhone will be, but the more time it will take to unlock your device. If you try to fill in 5 different wrong pass codes, your iPhone will be blocked for a minute. If after that you fill in a wrong passcode again, the device will be blocked for another 5 minutes. So the time the iPhone is blocked will increase if you keep filling in the wrong passcode. If your device is locked you can still do an emergency call though.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Emergency</b>
					<br> On the Lock Screen you can always access the Emergency Dial, just press on the Emergency button on the Passcode View. From there you can Dial any number. You can also press on the Medical ID button to see your Medical ID (if you set it up in the Health app). In case of an emergency, someone could go there to see some information about yourself and the number of a person to contact.
					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Siri</b>
					<br> You can access Siri from the Lock Screen like anywhere else by a long press on the Home button. From there you can ask anything as long as it doesn’t have to access personal data from your device. Otherwise it will ask for your passcode.
					<br>
					<br> This is a work in progress. More coming soon...
